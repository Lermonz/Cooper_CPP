# files made!
i have made a few pd files, the ones i'm leaning towards actually fleshing out more are the polyphony.pd, and polysynth.cl.pd, which are actually linked.

that file has a sequence of notes set up to be played by a slightly detuned wavetable synth with currently 4 waves selectable via a radio.

it's currently not the most fleshed out or whatever but i think it's kinda cool. it'll get cooler i swear

i learned about cloning and linking stuff together and basically everything i have in here from a cool tutorial series about pd

[this set of tutorials on tumblr](https://reallyusefulplugins.tumblr.com/richsynthesis) has proven very useful (heh) and it has all of the finished pd files from the tutorial vids easily available for download so i can use as reference

i've learned a lot from this series

i also looked at [martin brinkmann's instruments](http://www.martin-brinkmann.de/pd-patches.html), but they are scarier, so i've mostly just like, been in awe at them instead of learnign from them
