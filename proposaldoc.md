# what i wanna do
Make an interactable audio visualizer in openframeworks that takes osc messages from audio generators built into puredata. 
so basically like that mtof stuff A showed off.
and also have a little character you can control in the openframeworks window that changes how the audio is perceived.

ideas: 
- design instruments inside puredata to use for the audio output
- sequence music so it's not just random notes
- have triggerable things inside the openframeworks scene that changes the playback of the audio
- as the audio changes the background and colors and cool stuff in the openframeworks scene
